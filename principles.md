<span class="mono-bold">Operating Principles</span>

<span class="mono-bold">1. We Are the Agents</span>

- We believe in human agency. We as humans have explicit intent and use every tool available to fulfill that intent.
- Our collective neural diversity is our strength and our moat.
- Leverage technology maximally but do not be lazy. Remember that you are the axe. Keep your mind sharp and do not ignorantly become the facilitator of another’s intent.

<span class="mono-bold">2. Craft Beauty</span>

- The world needs beauty and craft.
- Only you can bring your own version of beauty into the world.
- To craft something well requires effort and mastery. We celebrate both.

<span class="mono-bold">3. Be Charming</span>

- Being polite and charming goes a long way, especially under stress.
- We treat others in a way that brings lightness, maybe even a smile.
- We tend to overestimate how well others understand our thoughts. Remember to overcommunicate.

<span class="mono-bold">4. Thoughtful but Relentless</span>

- As our strength and power increases, so should the consideration we give to our actions and decisions. As we grow and succeed, we become more thoughtful and less callous.
- We are considerate and thoughtful, but when we have determined the best course of action, we are relentless in the pursuit of those objectives.

<span class="mono-bold">5. Technology Is the Means, Not the End</span>

- We use software, because that’s what we know.
- But we are not here to sell cute code, fun algorithms or programming languages.
- If we could run this business on a spreadsheet better than with code, we would.

<span class="mono-bold">6. Ambitious Goals, Credible Steps</span>

- We are not afraid to be incredibly ambitious.
- But we are meticulous about forming credible plans.
- We need to convince ourselves of the path, and understand how we step into the sky.

<span class="mono-bold">7. Radical Responsibility, Generous Recognition</span>

- Each individual should think like an owner of the Company.
- Every task has a clear owner; that owner has clear responsibility.
- We look to recognize the contributions of others before those of ourselves.
