Earendil is a public benefit corporation with four facets to its purpose. These are embedded in our founding charter.

*Craft software and open protocols.* We believe in craft and we believe in open. Software governs how information is understood and increasingly, how reality is perceived. That comes with responsibility.

*Strengthen human agency.* In a world hurtling towards AI, we believe the human is the best agent. AI is possibly the most powerful tool humanity has ever seen, but we wield the hammer, the hammer does not wield us.

*Bridge division and ignorance.* Humanity is a community. We should look to our commonality rather than our differences. We should seek to ground ourselves in truth and then share that truth with one another.

*Cultivate joy and understanding.* Our tools should bring people joy and should help us to share in that joy through mutual understanding.
