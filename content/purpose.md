**Earendil** is a public benefit corporation founded by **<a href="https://mitsuhiko.at/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Armin Ronacher</a>** and **<a href="https://c01.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin Daymond Hanna</a>** with four facets to its purpose. These are embedded in our founding charter.

**Craft software and open protocols**  
We believe in craft and we believe in open. Software governs how information is understood and increasingly, how reality is perceived. That comes with responsibility.

**Strengthen human agency**  
In a world hurtling towards AI, we believe humans are the best agents. AI is possibly the most powerful tool humanity has ever seen, but we wield the hammer, the hammer does not wield us.

**Bridge division and ignorance**   
Humanity is a community. We choose to look to our commonalities rather than our differences.  
We look to ground ourselves in truth and share truth with one another.

**Cultivate lasting joy and understanding**  
Our products seek to bring people lasting joy and greater mutual understanding.
