Earendil was formed to craft software and open protocols to strengthen human
agency.

Open standards, the Internet and AI all have the power to greatly enhance what
humanity can achieve.  We believe it is important that we build mechanisms that
strengthen our capabilities rather than diminish them.  Technology should
enhance our ability to realize our intentions, it should work to empower
networks as a whole rather than select actors.

Because of that our approach towards crafting technology is deliberately biased
towards artifacts like URLs, emails, web protocols and open source software.

Ambitiously, we want to build a company that excels at improving communication
(be it human-machine, machine-human, human-human or machine-machine).  We want
to help humans communicate more effectively and truthfully, while at the same
time onboarding machines onto humanityâ€™s greatest communication protocol.  We
want to help map human intent to machines with maximum truth and minimal loss.
We may one day even look to help optimize how intelligent machines communicate
amongst one another with new languages.
