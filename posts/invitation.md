Hello,

We believe in building in the open, sharing what we learn, what we craft, and where we're headed. If you're curious about software that strengthens human agency and bridges understanding, we'd love to have you along for the journey.

<a href="/posts/subscribe/">[Leave us your email]</a> to receive posts from us. Honest reflections on what we're building, why it matters, and what we're shaping together.  Written by humans, not machines.  We welcome your comments.

We work out of <span class="mono-bold">Vienna, Austria</span>, a city of coffee, culture, and good conversation. If you're passing through and want to say hello, drop us a line at <a href="mailto:rfc@earendil.com">rfc@earendil.com</a>. The door is open.

With care,  
Armin and Colin
