<span class="mono-bold">Company Values</span>

<span class="mono-bold">1. Be Compassionate</span>

- Be kind. We are people first and workers second. Remember that people have bad days.
- Reach first for generosity. The world is not zero sum. We can create abundance collectively.
- Assuming bad intentions is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Assuming grace leads to grace.

<span class="mono-bold">2. Focused Excellence</span>

- We focus on what is under our control. We don’t let the rest distract us.
- What is under our control we deliver with pride. We harness focus to deliver excellence.
- We focus on excellent outcomes rather than excellent processes.

<span class="mono-bold">3. We, Not I</span>

- We believe the best teams are greater than the sum of their parts.
- We look to maximize team utility, but recognize one another’s strengths and weaknesses.
- We carry ourselves individually with humility. As a team we project confidence.

<span class="mono-bold">4. Family First</span>

- Our family could be our closest friends, our parents, siblings, our spouse and kids, or our dogs. These are the relationships that will define our lives. They come first.
- We pursue our work with intensity and high standards, but we refuse to sacrifice one for the other. In conflicts, family takes precedence.

<span class="mono-bold">5. Originally Curious</span>

- We stay curious and hungry for new knowledge.
- We are humble enough to accept there is much we do not know, but confident enough to challenge received wisdom through our own reason.
- We celebrate original thinking.

<span class="mono-bold">6. Transparently Vulnerable</span>

- Vulnerability breeds trust, concealment breeds distance.
- Minimize assumptions and gossip. When in doubt, validate directly with the primary source.
- Pursuing truth means acknowledging mistakes. Revealing mistakes should be celebrated, not criticized.

<span class="mono-bold">7. Positive Intentions & Outcomes</span>

- We care deeply about contributing to positive outcomes.
- We can look into our parents, partners, friends, or kids’ eyes, share with them both the purpose and the reality of what we have built, including any negative externalities, and feel pride.
- Keep the north star north. We do not compromise our clarity of purpose.
