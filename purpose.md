<a href="/" class="mono-bold">Earendil</a> is a public benefit corporation founded by <a href="https://mitsuhiko.at/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Armin Ronacher</a> and <a href="https://c01.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin Daymond Hanna</a>

<span class="mono-bold">Our purpose is embedded in our founding charter:</span>

<span class="mono-bold">Craft software and open protocols</span><br>We believe in craft and we believe in open. Software shapes how information is understood and increasingly, how reality is perceived. That comes with responsibility.

<span class="mono-bold">Strengthen human agency</span><br>In a world hurtling towards AI, we believe humans are the best agents. AI is possibly the most powerful tool humanity has ever seen, but we wield the hammer, the hammer does not wield us.

<span class="mono-bold">Bridge division and ignorance</span><br>Humanity is a community. We choose to look to our commonalities rather than our differences. We look to ground ourselves in truth and share truth with one another.

<span class="mono-bold">Cultivate lasting joy and understanding</span><br>Our products seek to bring people lasting joy and greater mutual understanding.
